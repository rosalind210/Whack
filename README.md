We love plants and we should love ourselves as much as our plants. This web application will help you take care of yourself by taking care of your plant.

When you eat, your sun grows and your plant takes in nutrients. When you shower, your plant gets water. When you exercise, you fertilize the ground your plant has rooted in. All of these actions help your plant grow, and in doing these activities yourself, you grow to, you grow healthy.
